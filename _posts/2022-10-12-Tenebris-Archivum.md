# The Vaults of the Tenebris Archivum

Deep beneath the heart of the Tenebris Archivum, that most ancient repository of the galaxy’s secret history, there is a labyrinthine network of stores known simply as the Vaults.

Here, in halls that may dwarf a city, and alcoves barely large enough to fit an archivist, the keepers of the cosmos’s knowledge sequester the innumerable accounts, records, and myths surrounding the the greatest conflict the stars have ever witnessed. 

It is a history so ancient, so mired in mythologizing and revision, a legend so beyond the reckoning of any mortal mind, the truth of what happened those countless aeons past must surely be lost forever.

And yet, the tale would be told. 

The saga would be sung.

The story of a time when the very firmament shook with the beating of war drums.

The story of Bellum Caelum
