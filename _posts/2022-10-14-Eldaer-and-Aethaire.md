# An Ocean of Power

There exists another realm, beyond, beneath, and inextricably interwoven with the material universe. It is at once folded up within, suffused throughout, and expanded beyond the mundane plane of existence.

This hidden space has been glimpsed by many species, and given countless names â€” misinterpreted and misunderstood by nearly all who, in their insipid dreams, caught the glimmer of a reflection of some small portion of its boundless beauty.

To the Eldaer, this place beyond is known as the Aethaire, and it is the very foundation upon which the wonders of their civilisation is built.

The Aethaire is in one sense a reflecting pool for the sentient creatures of the ordinary cosmos. Though the feelings and impressions of those on this plane may be distorted, perhaps beyond recognition, in the glassy waters of the Other Place, yet they are reflected.

Not until the birth of the Eldaer civilisation, however, has there been a creature of the material realm capable of drawing on the power of the Aethaire so masterfully. To the Eldaer, the Aethaire is not simply a distorting mirror to the psychic self, but a great store of energy, a place to draw from, to weave into the physical plane. In the waters of the Elsewhere the Eldaer can glimpse the forms of future fate, from the energies that lie beneath they can create and craft objects that defy ordinary physics, and, their bodies alive with those mysterious powers, the Eldaer can perform feats far beyond the capability of lesser species.

But the powers of the Aethaire are not wholly benign. As a thrill-seeker overestimating their limits may reach too far and tumble to their doom, or an addict chasing ever more extreme stimulation may succumb to a fatal dose, so too an Eldaer without self-control or skill may find themselves consumed by the powers of the Aethaire. Most will simply die. Those who do not risk a more profoundly terrible fate.

To ward against this, Eldaer society has formed around a system of freely associative institutions, each concerned with a different societal need and employing different methods of guiding the ambitions and vigour of the Eldaer. Collectively, these institutions are known as the Sanctuaries.
