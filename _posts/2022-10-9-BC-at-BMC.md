# We've got a game!
Not much beats a sunny Sunday at your FLGS, playing a game with a mate, and having a cheeky afternoon pint.  
Or so I thought until I started developing my own game. Now the heady pleasure of shuffling little soldiers and rolling fistfuls of dice is made all the sweeter by seeing all the hours of work finally coalesce into something ... fun!

Me and War Master Chris met up at the excellent [Bad Moon Cafe](https://www.badmooncafe.co.uk/) here in South London for an all too brief catch-up and play test of version 0.0.6 of Bellum Caelum.

The mission was a little ad-hoc number I came up with on the bus on the way there (good to keep yourself on your toes) and went something like this:

>*On the fringe world of Basr-Mein, the galaxy's two bitterest rivals have had a chance encounter -- and the stakes could not be higher. The forward scouting force of the Nekhra, taking advantage of a surprise sighting, have downed an Eldaer fighter ship. Little did they know the ship contained a trove of Eldaeran intel, a bank of knowledge the Eldaeran's are loathe to lose. When the Eldaer  escort force arrived at the crash site, the Nekhra soon realised more was at stake than they first suspected. The psy-tech connections among the piece of wreckage are wreaking havoc, shuttling the pertinent information at random between the remains of the ship. Nonetheless, the race is now on to retrieve the intel, and perhaps influence the direction of the wider war.*  
>
>Take turns placing 5 numbered objective markers on the battlefield. At the start of each round, before the Orders Phase, roll one D6. The corresponding objective is worth three points for this round. All other objectives are worth one. If you roll a six in the first round, re-roll. If you roll a 6 in any other round, the three-point objective remains the same as the previous round.

It's a pretty simple mission, but it felt nicely thematic and had just enough chance to keep things in motion.

The high-scoring objective spent turn one in the Nekhra deployment zone, giving them an early advantage, but the nippy Eldaer pushed forward nonetheless, staking out the midboard.  
This forward play paid off turn two, when the intel zipped over the wasted psychic internet of the wrecked ship, and landed on an Eldaer-controlled objective. The elves were exposed though, and had to do their best to weather volleys of powerful Nekhra fire.  
In turn three, the intel remained in the mid board, and it became a pile on to see who could overwhelm the enemy on that key objective, while keeping a presence on the other objectives. Tricksy Eldaer movement, namely trading objectives between units to get hardier forces up front and the already damaged units behind cover, left them in a good position to win the three-pointer, but the unmatched might of the Nekhra's eldritch weaponry proved too much, blowing enough elves off the board to leave the high-points objective contested.  
Turns four and five saw a force mightier than even the Eldaer or Nekhra brought to bear - the early Sunday closing at Bad Moon Cafe.  
So there the game was curtailed, and tallying the scores left Chris and his mighty Nekhra's the deserved winners.

From a development point of view, I had a real blast. This was Chris's second game, and even with the changes since the last match, our confidence with the rules has already grown, and I'm beginning to get a sense of what the game actually feels like to play. There were lots of head scratching (in a good way!) tactical moments, deciding how to dish out orders and, importantly, in what order to activate them.  

It's not all roses, of course. There are always numbers to adjust and nuances to iron out. And the game is still relatively simple. Who knows what sort of havoc a new aspect of the rules will cause in the future.  

But for now, Bellum Caelum is fun, and the rules seem to be working!
