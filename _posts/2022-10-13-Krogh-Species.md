# Four As One

The Krogh are split into four closely related sub-species, namely the SkiqKrogh, the SnahKrogh, the GhettKrogh, and the KroghKha. With the exception of the Skiq, the Krogh are a sentient, bipedal species of green-skinned humanoids. They reproduce asexually through a fungal-like spore process,  with each subspecies containing the genetic information of all others. As such, it is possible for a single, isolated Krogh to eventually populate an entire world with a fully developed Krogh ecosystem. For this reason, despite their disparate appeance, the Krogh are usually treated as one species.

Of each of the subspecies, Skiq are the most variant, both within the subspecies itself, and from their wider Krogh kin. They range in colour from deep magenta, to bright orange-red, and are most frequently bipedal, though quadruped variants also occur. They are invariably hardy, muscular beasts, but are the least sapient of the Krogh, unusually amenable to training, but otherwise simple animals. 

Skiq are used by the Krogh as a staple food source, as beasts of burden, and, with technological augmentation, as steeds of war. Playing as vital a role in Krogh society as they do, Skiq are greatly revered, serving as a sort of totemic representation of the Krogh.

Snah are the smallest of the Green Krogh, standing at around a metre in height, and posses lither frames than their cousins. The Snah form the labouring caste in Krogh society. On the battlefield, they make up the rank and file foot soldiers of Krogh forces, and while they display a perfectly respectable degree of intelligence, due to innate physiological adaptations, the Snah will succumb to baser instincts and retrogressive cultural tendencies without the guidance of their larger siblings.

Ghett, on the other hand, are highly independent and intelligent, able to maintain social cohesion in isolation from Snah and KroghKha. Physically, the Ghett are stronger and taller than the Snah, standing at between one-and-a-half and two metres on average, though of course, they are still dwarfed by their Kha brethren. The middle ranks of command are occupied by the Ghett, as well as many specialist roles in Krogh society. On the battlefield, the Ghett can be found in roles as diverse as espionage specialist, vehicle pilot, and even commander. It is common for warlord Kha to maintain a small number of Ghett in advisory roles, so respected is their war acumen and general intelligence.

Finally, towering over their kin and making up the ruling caste, the KroghKha, or Great Krogh, are the formidable apex of Krogh socio-ecology.

Unlike Skiq, Snah and Ghett, KroghKha, usually referred to as simply Kha, can grow indefinitely. It is common for a Kha to surpass eight metres in height, and they will often grow to twelve or more metres, while the largest of their kind dwarf any vehicle, standing shoulder to shoulder with the Titans of other races. Krogh of these truly epic proportions gain a semi-godlike status amongst their kin, and are referred to as KroghMotKha.

For all their remarkable physical and mental prowess, however, the KroghKha are single-minded, devoting themselves to the art of war almost to the exclusion of all else. Without the sustenance provided by the Skiq, the labour of the Snah, and the organisation offered by the Ghett, Kha would be liable to devote themselves exclusively to war, succumbing eventually to barbary and perhaps even starvation. It may be hard for other, more individually balanced races to square this fact with their knowledge of the Krogh as a noble, hardy, and exceptionally intelligent species, but the contradiction is resolved by considering Krogh society as a whole - countless individuals behaving as a single organic entity.
