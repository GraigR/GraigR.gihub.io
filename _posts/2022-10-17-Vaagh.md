## Honour, Duty, Fealty, and Valour

Krogh society is exceptionally hierarchical. The castes that keep Krogh culture functioning are built into the biological makeup of the constituent species, and likewise the sense of honour and duty that typifies the Krogh seems to be encoded on a genetic level.

The lower sentient species of Krogh, namely the Snah and Ghett, have an almost childlike reverence for the imposing KroghKha, and in return the Kha feel an all-consuming dedication to not only protect, but also expand the Krogh sphere of control, that they and their kin may prosper. 

Left unchecked, the reverence of the lowly can devolve into cultish worship, and the zealotry of the lofty may spiral into maniacal war-madness. For this reason, Krogh society is bound tightly by a code known as the Vaagh — a system of honour and duty that directs the baser instincts of the Krogh into focused and formidable acuity and strength. 

Perhaps the most obvious outward manifestation of Vaagh is the propensity of Krogh, particularly the Kha, for close-quarters combat. Locking weapons with a foe in the heat of battle is seen by Krogh as the only truly honourable method of combat, and while pragmatism, particularly that of the Ghett, permits the use of ranged weaponry, for the Kha, an enemy destroyed at any great remove is not, per se, an enemy bested in the art of war.

There is a subtler, more esoteric facet to the Vaagh, however — one that binds the Krogh beyond any normal societal bond.

## Gestalt Powers

The term Vaagh not only refers to the strict system of honour that holds the Krogh together, but also the subtler psychic powers that manifest as their numbers increase.

Unlike other psychic races in the galaxy, the Krogh do not interact with the Aethaire, perhaps at all, but certainly not directly.

Instead, the Krogh derive their power from one another, with each additional Krogh adding more to the gestalt energy than they take — a sort of psychic feedback loop knitting each Krogh to every other. 

In sufficient numbers, at close enough proximity, and with the channel provided by the VeerDah — that class of Krogh concerned specifically with shaping and directing the energies of the Vaagh — this power can be used to perform reality-defying feats. With a skilled enough VeerDah and a large enough pool of psychic power to draw on, entire Krogh forces are teleported through space and directly into enemy lines; vehicles beyond the repair capabilities of even the most skilled technicians roar back into life, hardier and more deadly than the day they left the Ghett workshops; and perhaps most terrifyingly, the powers of the greatest KroghMotKha are redoubled, manifesting a near-unstoppable super-warrior that dwarfs its foes in both physical size and martial prowess.

Even when these powers are not channelled into such abilities, the latent network of Vaagh energies allows for preternatural coordination and communication between the Krogh. Without exchanging a word, a unit of Ghett may know instinctually of a Kha in need of supporting fire across the battlefield, or two units of Snah, without direct command, may know to regroup as a single squadron to form a bulwark against an oncoming enemy attack.
