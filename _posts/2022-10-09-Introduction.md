# Welcome!
Hi Hobby Friends!

Welcome to Bellum Caelum, a fast-paced, 6mm scale, miniature agnostic, forever free fan game set in the distant past of everyone's favourite science-fantasy war game franchise.

In the universe of Bellum Caelum, psychically ferocious space elves and hulking, cunning orcs battle against soulless mechanised undead abominations for the sake of all life in the galaxy. 

The game is still very much in development, with additions and amendments being made all the time, and this site will act as the record of that development, as well as the place to find all the latest info and rules.

If you're a crunch-craving gamer ready to dive into play testing, check out the Core Rules post, and if you're a lore-loving fluffster, go and explore the Tenebris Archivum.

Happy Hobbying!
